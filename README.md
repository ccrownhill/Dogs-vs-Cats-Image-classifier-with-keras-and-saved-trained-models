# Dogs-vs-Cats-Image-classifier-with-keras-and-saved-trained-models
3 keras models trained on dogs vs cats dataset from kaggle with script to use any of those models to predict some image

The code for any of the trained model saves model1.h5, model2.h5 and model3.h5 is in the respective model{n}.py file
In order to make a prediction on any .jpg image you need to use the predict.py file like this

```python predict.py "image file" "saved model file"```
